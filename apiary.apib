# Kentico Deliver â€“ Developer documentation

Welcome to Kentico Deliver API documentation for developers! Learn how you can use the API to deliver content to your web applications and mobile applications. 

The Kentico Deliver API is a RESTfull API. It returns content from Kentico Cloud in the JSON format. We try to keep our API clean and straightforward using standard best practices.

## What is Kentico Deliver

Kentico Deliver is an **API-first CMS**, which enables you to develop websites or mobile applications in your favorite language and technology. 
It removes the hassle around a traditional CMS and its technology limitations. 

While copywriters can produce content in a cloud application, [Kentico Draft](https://draft.kenticocloud.com), 
developers can use Kentico Deliver API to develop the website or mobile application with real content, or preview unpublished content to see how it fits your code.

## Before you start

Before you begin exploring Kentico Deliver API, let us walk you through the way the content is structured in Kentico Deliver and what are the standard practices in working with the API:

### How content is structured in Kentico Deliver
When you start using Kentico Deliver, you will also get a sample project. A project is the primary organizational unit. It consists of:

* Content models
* Content inventory
* Workflow

#### Content models
You can **define** content types, sitemap, and taxonomy for a project. 

Content types consist of smaller content elements, which define its structure. 
There are different types of content elements, such as Text, Number, Date & Time, Asset, Modular content or Taxonomy: 
* **Asset** content element serves as a placeholder into which you can upload multiple files.
* **Modular content** content element allows you to build relationships because it can hold references to other content items.
* **Taxonomy** content element allows you to assign taxonomy terms from the associated taxonomy group to a content item. This helps you identify similar content, thematic content or content that is relevant to a particular audience.

Content items can also be assigned to multiple locations within a sitemap. **Sitemap** is a hierarchical structure which helps you filter and navigate through the content you are working on.

#### Content inventory
In the Content inventory you can **create** actual content items (i.e., articles) based on the models you have defined in Content types. You can then update or delete these content items.

#### Workflow
In the Workflow section, you can **customize workflow steps** that you want to label the content items with. You can then use the workflow steps to refine items in the Content inventory section.
* You can read more about Kentico Deliver in the [documentation](https://kenticocloud.com/docs).

### Where you can access the API
You can deliver **published** content from your project using the production URI: `https://deliver.kenticocloud.com/<project_id>`

You can preview **unpublished** content from your project using the preview URI: `https://preview-deliver.kenticocloud.com/<project_id>`

To test-drive the API, you can perform requests in your favorite browser or other tool, such as [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). 

Note that you must replace `<project_id>` with an existing Deliver project ID.

### What you need to include in every request
Every API request you make must contain the ID of your Kentico Deliver project. 

You can get the **project ID** in the administration interface of your project - see [Getting project ID](https://kenticocloud.com/docs#getting-project-id).

### What are the typical server responses
Every response follows the same rules. In the following list you can see the response statuses in different situations and what the responses look like.

#### Typical Server Responses
*   <code>200</code> **OK** - You can read what are The request was successful
*   <code>400</code> **Bad Request** - The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters
*   <code>401</code> **Unauthorized** - Authentication failed or user does not have permissions for the requested operation
*   <code>403</code> **Forbidden** - Access denied
*   <code>404</code> **Not Found** - Resource was not found
*   <code>405</code> **Method Not Allowed** - Requested method is not supported for the specified resource
*   <code>429</code> **Too Many Requests** - Request is rejected due to rate limiting as defined in 
    [rfc6585](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4). Value of <code>Retry-After</code> header (seconds) must be respected.  
    
    Additionaly each response under rate limitation includes the following headers:
    * `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` rate limit period definion (example: `1d`, `15m`)
    * `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` the number of remaining requests in the current period
    * `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` current period end time (example: `8/6/2016 7:54:40 AM`)

#### Response structure
Every content item in an API response contains a `system` object. This attribute cannot be omitted using any query. 
However, you might want to use the information this object provides in your application. 

The following table describes the attributes that are present in the `system` object:

| Property          | Type   | Description                                           |
|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| id                | string | Unique identifier of the content item                 |
| name              | string | Display name of the content item                      |
| codename          | string | Codename of the content item                         |
| type              | string | Codename of a content type                           |
| sitemap_locations | array  | Codenames of sitemap locations                       |
| last_modified     | date   | Date and time when the content item was last modified | 

```
{
    "system": {
        "id": "cf106f4e-30a4-42ef-b313-b8ea3fd3e5c5",
        "name": "Coffee Beverages Explained",
        "codename": "coffee_beverages_explained",
        "type": "article",
        "sitemap_locations": [
            "articles"
        ],
        "last_modified": "2016-09-08T09:33:45.567364Z"
    }
}
```

### How to resolve and report errors
Failed requests contain information helpful for identifying and resolving the issue. 

* Response status code. See [typical server responses](#introduction/before-you-start/what-are-the-typical-server-responses).
* Error reason specified in the response body `message` attribute.
```
{
    "message": "Query parameter 'limit' must be a positive integer."
}
``` 

If you cannot identify the issue or you have found a bug, please let us know at [deliver@kentico.com](mailto:deliver@kentico.com) with the response status code and error reason.

### How to authorize preview requests
Published content in Kentico Deliver is public, and related API requests don't need authorization. However, unpublished content is not publicly available, and needs special authorization. 

Therefore, you must **include Preview API key in the Authorization header of every preview request**. You can get your Preview API key in the administration interface of your [Kentico Deliver project](https://kenticocloud.com/docs#previewing-unpublished-content-using-deliver-api). 

Save this key and include it in the Authorization header of all Kentico Deliver Preview API requests. 

The Authorization header should look like the following:

<pre>Authorization:Bearer {API key}</pre>

## Sample scenarios
Often, content delivery requires a complex understanding of Kentico Deliver API. The following use cases might help you get started:

* [Get titles and images of ten latest articles](#introduction/sample-scenarios/get-titles-and-images-of-ten-latest-articles)
* [Get all articles tagged with a specific taxonomy term](#introduction/sample-scenarios/get-all-articles-tagged-with-a-specific-taxonomy-term)
* [Get a specific article](#introduction/sample-scenarios/preview-a-specific-article)

### Get titles and images of ten latest articles
In this scenario, we will show you how to:
* filter Content items by Content type, 
* order the Content items, 
* get only the top ten Content items,
* get only specific Content elements.

#### 1. Get project ID
All content items are part of a project. You must include the project ID in every API request. 
* You can find the project ID in the administration interface of your project - see [Getting project ID](https://kenticocloud.com/docs#getting-project-id).

After getting the project ID, include it in the request URI. The following URI gets all content items:

`https://deliver.kenticocloud.com/e391c776-9d1e-4e1a-8a5a-1c327c2586b6/items`

#### 2. Get just articles
You can filter content items by content type by including the `system.type` query parameter and the content type codename. 
* You can find a content type codename in the administration interface of your project - see [Getting codenames of objects](https://kenticocloud.com/docs#getting-codenames-of-objects).

After getting the content type codename, include it in the request URI. The following URI gets all articles:

`https://deliver.kenticocloud.com/e391c776-9d1e-4e1a-8a5a-1c327c2586b6/items?system.type=article`

Note that the content type is a part of the system attributes. Therefore, the query parameters begin with `system.`. 
You can see the [full list of system attributes](#introduction/before-you-start/what-the-typical-server-response-looks-like).

#### 3. Order articles by publish date
You can filter content items by content type by including the `order` query parameter and a content element codename. 
* You can find a content element codename in the administration interface of your project - see [Getting codenames of objects](https://kenticocloud.com/docs#getting-codenames-of-objects).

After getting the content element codename, include it in the request URI. The following URI gets all articles ordered from the most recent to the least recent:

`https://deliver.kenticocloud.com/e391c776-9d1e-4e1a-8a5a-1c327c2586b6/items?system.type=article&order=elements.post_date[desc]`

Note that you can order content items in ascending or descending order.

#### 4. Get just ten latest articles
When getting a large collection of content items, you can get only a small subset by using the `skip` and `limit` query parameters. 

To get only the ten latest articles, you can add the following query parameter:

`https://deliver.kenticocloud.com/e391c776-9d1e-4e1a-8a5a-1c327c2586b6/items?system.type=article&order=elements.post_date[desc]&limit=10`

#### 5. Get just titles and images
You can retrieve only certain content elements of a content item, for example when displaying a preview of an article. 
You can add the `elements` query parameter and a comma-separated list of content element codenames to get only the specified content elements.

The following URI gets all titles and teaser images of articles ordered from the most recent to the least recent:

`https://deliver.kenticocloud.com/e391c776-9d1e-4e1a-8a5a-1c327c2586b6/items?system.type=article&order=elements.post_date[desc]&limit=10&elements=title,teaser_image`

Note that the system properties are always returned in the response.

### Get all articles tagged with a specific taxonomy term
You can specify a taxonomy content element in a content type. All content items of that type can be linked with specific taxonomy terms. 

In this scenario, we will show you how to get only the content items with a specific taxonomy term.

#### 1. Get taxonomy term codename
First, you need to get the taxonomy term codename. 
* You can find a taxonomy term codename in the administration interface of your project - see [Getting codenames of objects](https://kenticocloud.com/docs#getting-codenames-of-objects).

#### 2. Get only articles with a specific taxonomy term
Taxonomy content element contains a list of taxonomy term codenames, which are linked to it. 
You can add the `elements.taxonomy_element_name[contains]` query parameter and a taxonomy term codename to get only the content items linked with the given taxonomy term.

The following URI gets all articles for a visitor persona:

`https://deliver.kenticocloud.com/e391c776-9d1e-4e1a-8a5a-1c327c2586b6/items?elements.persona[contains]=visitor`

### Preview a specific article
You can preview a draft version of a content item to check how the content fits your code. 

In this scenario, we will show you how to use Kentico Deliver Preview API to preview a specific article.

#### 1. Get Preview API key
All preview requests need to be authorized with an API key. 
* See [how to authorize your requests](#introduction/before-you-start/how-to-authorize-your-requests) for details.

#### 2. Get specific article
You can get a specific content item by specifying its codename in the URI. 
* You can find a content item codename in the administration interface of your project - see [Getting codenames of objects](https://kenticocloud.com/docs#getting-codenames-of-objects).

The following URI gets the only article with the `about_us` codename:

`https://preview-deliver.kenticocloud.com/e391c776-9d1e-4e1a-8a5a-1c327c2586b6/items/about_us`


## All Content items [/{project_id}/items{?system%2etype,elements%2epersonas%5Bcontains%5D,elements,order,depth,skip,limit}]

You can get all content items in a project using the `/<project_id>/items` endpoint.

### Filtering
You can filter large sets of content items by building query parameters from content elements and system attributes.
* To filter by a **system attribute**, include `system.<attribute_name>` query parameter.
* To filter by a **content element value**, include `elements.<content_element_name>` query parameter.

You can use the following operators:


|Parameter |Description              | Query parameter example                                                       |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|=         |Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has the specified value. |`elements.product_name=Hario%20V60` |
|[lt]      |Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has a value that is less then the specified value. |`elements.price[lt]=10`                                                        |
|[lte]     |Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has a value that is less then or equal to the specified value. |`elements.price[lte]=4`                                                        |
|[gt]      |Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has a value that is greater then the specified value. |`elements.price[gt]=1000`                                                      |
|[gte]     |Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has a value that is greater then or equal to the specified value. |`elements.price[gte]=50`                                                       |
|[range]   |Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has a value that falls within the specified range of values (both inclusive). |`elements.price[range]=50,100`, `elements.country[range]=Guatemala,Nicaragua`|
|[in]      |Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has a value that matches any value in the specified list. |`system.type[in]=cafe,coffee`|
|[contains]|Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has a value that contains the specified value. This filter is applicable to array values only, such as sitemap location or modular content, taxonomy and multiple choice elements. |`system.sitemap_locations[contains]=cafes`|
|[any]     |Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has a value that contains any of the specified values. This filter is applicable to array values only, such as sitemap location or modular content, taxonomy and multiple choice elements. |`elements.personas[any]=barista,coffee_blogger`|
|[all]     |Matches a content item if the specified content element or system attribute has a value that contains all the specified values. This filter is applicable to array values only, such as sitemap location or modular content, taxonomy and multiple choice elements. |`elements.personas[all]=barista,coffee_blogger`|

Note that you can join multiple filtering query parameters using the `&` character. 

Queries with two or more filtering query parameters are more restrictive since individual query parameters are merged with a logical conjunction. 
For example, query `system.type=article&system.sitemap_locations[contains]=cafes` will return all `articles` which are in the `cafes` section of the sitemap.

### Ordering
You can order returned content items by a content element value.

* To order content items **ascending**, add `order=elements.<element_name>[asc]` query parameter.
* To order content items **descending**, add `order=elements.<element_name>[desc]` query parameter.

### Paging
When getting a large collection of content items, you can get only a small subset by using the `skip` and `limit` query parameters. 

This might be useful when displaying a specific page of content items.

* To get the second page of content items with page size 10, you can add the `skip=10&limit=10` query parameters.

### Projection
You can retrieve only certain content elements of a content item using the `elements` query parameter. 

Note that the system properties are always returned in the response as well.

### Modular content
Some content items might reference modular content items. Recursively, these modular content items might have their modular content items. By default, only one level of modular content is returned.
* If you want to **include more** than one level of modular content items in response, use the `depth` query parameter. 
* If you want to **exclude** all modular content, use the `depth=0` query parameter.
